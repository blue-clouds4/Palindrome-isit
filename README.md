# Palindrome-isit
random java program I thought of doing because i was bored
<br>
plaindrome input is an input in which the same text is present after switching the characters in it
<br>
suppose:
<br>
- racecar: we inverse the characters and then we get the same answer
- 505: we inverse the characters and then we still get the same answer
- ?%?: we inverse the characters and then we still get the same answer
